        <h2>Afraid of the Dark</h2>
        <p>
            When I was a young child, I had typically slept in the same room as my older brother, so I never had any
            issues with being scared of the dark.
            However, he soon moved to his own room, and that's when the trouble started. For some reason, I was now very
            uneasy with the lights off, so
            this led to me getting a <span id="nightlight">____</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One night I had a very vivid nightmare where I was staring at the closet and the door slowly opened. A large
            <span id="monster">____</span> crawled out of the closet
            and waved at me, causing me to wake up with a start and being covered in sweat. From then on, I could not go
            to bed without opening the closet door to
            make sure nothing was inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I grew older I continued to have problems so my mom would sit outside in the hallway and work on <span
                id="crossword">____</span> puzzles to pass the time until I fell asleep.
            Little did I know this would lead to me becoming interested in what crossword puzzles were and starting to
            do some on my own. Overtime it became
            a great bonding activity for my mom and me to work one together.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess eventually my being afraid of the dark went away. I don't know if it was the presence of my mom
            being outside, the nightmare becoming less vivid in my mind, or
            a part of just getting older. It's interesting to see how childhood fears go away. And in case you were
            curious for the phobia of being scared of the dark, it's
            <span id="nyctophobia">____</span>.
