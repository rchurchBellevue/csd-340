        <h2> A Personal Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">I was born in 1981 in Louisville,Kentucky.  My mother's family had lived in Louisville for years and my father came
            to Louisville to pursue his medical degree.  My mom had worked as a teacher at St Athanasius before she met my father, and they were 
            married in 1978
        </p>
        <p> It was not long before they started a family.  My older brother Matt was born in 1979, and I was born two years later in February of 1981.
            My younger sister megan was born the next year, and my youngest sister Emily was the last sibling born in 1984. 
            Between my father's pediatric practice and four young children, it must have been an exciting few years for my parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            My grade school was right behind our house, so the entire sibling crew had a short walk to school.  After grade school, I went to St Xavier High school
            and then Bellarmine University in 1999.  <span class="sentence">I was originally a chemistry major, switched to a Philosophy degree, and ended up graduating
            with a double major in Philosophy and Mathematics.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I tend to lead a quiet but content life.  I've been married for almost 20 years, to my wife Jeni who I met in college.  We have worked 
            with several animal rescue groups in our times, so we currently have a family of seven cats we've adopted from several agencies.  In terms of hobbies,
            I'm a dedicated runner, a reader of books in all different genres, and also a fan of gardening and DIY projects around the house.
